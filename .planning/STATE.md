## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 8 phases following strict dependency chain (tokens -> enforcement -> shell -> state -> websocket -> streaming -> proof-of-life -> navigation)
- Roadmap: Phase 5 (WebSocket) flagged for research — exact message shapes from CloudCLI backend must be audited before execution
- Roadmap: Tailwind version needs empirical OKLCH compatibility check before Phase 1 execution
- 01-01: React 19 used instead of 18 (Vite template ships 19 now, backwards compatible)
- 01-01: Placeholder tokens.css created with dark theme defaults for immediate build viability
- 01-01: ESLint kept react-hooks and react-refresh plugins from Vite scaffold alongside Constitution rules
- 01-02: All OKLCH values used exactly as specified — warm charcoal hue 32, dusty rose hue 20
- 01-02: Extended @theme inline with diff, rose, and secondary-foreground utility mappings for complete coverage
- 01-03: TokenPreview uses fixed inset-0 positioning (not min-h-dvh) to work with overflow:hidden body
- 01-03: Dev server port moved from 5173 to 5184 to avoid V1 collision
- 01-03: Spring Lab uses CSS cubic-bezier approximation -- full LazyMotion in M3
- 02-01: File-level eslint-disable for TokenPreview no-banned-inline-style (dev visualization tool needs dynamic styles)
- 02-01: z-10 Tailwind utility replaced with var(--z-sticky) token in TokenPreview
- 02-01: @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars upgraded from warn to error
- 02-01: eslint-rules/ directory added to ESLint ignores (plain JS, not linted as app code)
- 02-02: App.tsx excluded from coverage (routing shell, not application logic)
- 02-02: Node types added to tsconfig.app.json for test file Node.js API access
- 02-02: Test files colocated with source files (*.test.ts beside *.ts)
- 02-02: import.meta.url + fileURLToPath used instead of __dirname for ESM compat
- 02-03: vitest related --run (affected tests only) in pre-commit instead of full vitest run --coverage for <30s hook
- 02-03: lint-staged config runs only eslint --fix; tests run as separate hook step to avoid re-staging race condition
- 03-01: gridTemplateColumns/gridTemplateRows added to ESLint inline-style allowlist (Constitution 3.2 explicitly permits dynamic grid values)
- 03-01: Test files exempted from no-external-store-mutation ESLint rule (Zustand testing requires setState/getState)
- 03-01: Expand trigger uses z-[var(--z-overlay)] (40), above sticky headers but below modals
- 03-01: AppRoutes exported separately from App for MemoryRouter testing
- 03-01: --sidebar-expanded-width token added to tokens.css for parameterized sidebar width
- [Phase 03]: gridTemplateColumns/Rows added to ESLint inline-style allowlist per Constitution 3.2
- [Phase 03]: Test files exempted from no-external-store-mutation ESLint rule for Zustand testing
- [Phase 03]: Expand trigger z-index at --z-overlay (40) per Architect review

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 5 research dependency: CloudCLI WebSocket message shapes for all three providers need auditing from server/index.js before Phase 5 planning
- Phase 1 pre-check: Verify OKLCH values in CSS custom properties work with Tailwind v3.4 opacity modifier syntax
