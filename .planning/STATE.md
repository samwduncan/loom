**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Design Token System

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 8 (Design Token System)
Plan: 2 of 3 in current phase
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-03-05 — Completed Plan 01-02: Design token system + spring physics

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] 10%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: 5 min
- Total execution time: 0.17 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 2 | 10 min | 5 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 7m, 3m
- Trend: accelerating

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 8 phases following strict dependency chain (tokens -> enforcement -> shell -> state -> websocket -> streaming -> proof-of-life -> navigation)
- Roadmap: Phase 5 (WebSocket) flagged for research — exact message shapes from CloudCLI backend must be audited before execution
- Roadmap: Tailwind version needs empirical OKLCH compatibility check before Phase 1 execution
- 01-01: React 19 used instead of 18 (Vite template ships 19 now, backwards compatible)
- 01-01: Placeholder tokens.css created with dark theme defaults for immediate build viability
- 01-01: ESLint kept react-hooks and react-refresh plugins from Vite scaffold alongside Constitution rules
- 01-02: All OKLCH values used exactly as specified — warm charcoal hue 32, dusty rose hue 20
- 01-02: Extended @theme inline with diff, rose, and secondary-foreground utility mappings for complete coverage

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 5 research dependency: CloudCLI WebSocket message shapes for all three providers need auditing from server/index.js before Phase 5 planning
- Phase 1 pre-check: Verify OKLCH values in CSS custom properties work with Tailwind v3.4 opacity modifier syntax
